    | Sudo mode is an extra layer of security for your most sensitive pages.
    This is an implementation of GitHub's `Sudo Mode
    <https://github.com/blog/1513-introducing-github-sudo-mode>`_ for `Django
    <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_.

What is this for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``django-sudo`` provides an extra layer of security for after a user is already logged in. Views can
be decorated with ``@sudo_required``, and then a user
must re-enter their password to view that page. After verifying their password, that user has
elevated permissions for the duration of ``SUDO_COOKIE_AGE``. This duration is independent of the
normal session duration allowing short elevated permission durations, but retain long user sessions.
