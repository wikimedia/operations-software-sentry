        Sentry is a Server
        ------------------
        
        The Sentry package fundamentally is just a simple server and web UI. It will
        handle authenticating clients (such as `Raven <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python>`_)
        and all of the logic behind storage and aggregation.
        
        That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary implementation is in
        Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any language, in
        any application.
